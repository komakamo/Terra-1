# Image placeholders

This directory should contain the block texture references used by `index.html`:

- `blocks1.jpg`
- `blocks2.jpg`

These images were removed from version control to keep the repository lightweight. Download the originals from the project's shared asset bundle or supply your own textures using the same file names. Keep dimensions consistent with the originals for best results.
